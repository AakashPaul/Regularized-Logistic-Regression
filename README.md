# Regularized-Logistic-Regression
In this repository, we will implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA)

 During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. Suppose you are the product manager of the 
 factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests, you would like to determine 
 whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past 
 microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.
 
 This project has been done as a part of Andrew Ng's machine learning course in coursera . Although the course supports the use of 
 octave/Matlab the given project is written in python language because of its popularity in the industry.This is a very basic level program
 as i am just starting out with machine learning and getting to learn new algorithms.
